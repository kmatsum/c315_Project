This is our GUI application project. This does not use all the requirements for the project, but it is still a work in progress


Before running the code to run the application, several packages must be installed. The following lines of code need to be used (assuming everything is updated on the computer)
1) sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev


In order to run the application, you must type in "gcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` main.c -o "SampleRunName" `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0` -rdynamic" where SampleRunName is what
you type after ./


No folders or .glade files need to be moved
